                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                        </li>
                        <li>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are 
                            also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which 
                            tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Let's not forget the rapids! <i>They range from class I-IV.</i> The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
                            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
                            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but 
                            families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                        river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                        desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand 
                        Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting 
                        geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater 
                        opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Desolation is <i>rated a Class II/III</i> and is usually done in 6 days
                    </li>                   
                    <li>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
                        uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget 
                            your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        </li>
                        <li>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
                            unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but 
                            with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                        </li>                           
                        <li>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are <i>technically 
                            rated I - X ( 1 - 10)</i> to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most 
                            people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
