      <h3>Branding</h3>
      <p>
        From the colors applied in the logo to the company slogan, your visibility is our goal when we develop your brand. Strong branding 
        defines how people are going to remember your business. Establishing a good foundation for your brand with a clear purpose, promotion, 
        and personality are key factors to success. Aligning these factors to your purpose statement and business personality, colors, typography, 
        and especially your logo helps to tie customers to your company.<br>
        <strong>Fonts:</strong> The importance of defining a strong typographic palette resides in the tone and values of your company, also 
        tying communication consistency to your brand.<br> 
        <strong>Logo:</strong> The visual component that grabs the customer's attention. Having an impactful logo helps to make a strong first 
        impression. Also, it represents your company identity and what you stand for, separating you from others.<br>
        <strong>Colors:</strong> The key component of your brand. A good color palette sets the expression of emotions that your brand causes 
        in your clients. The logo helps your client to remember you, but your colors create an emotional connection that helps 
        him to connect with your brand.
