                Digital Revolution for Companies - Our Motivation
            </h1>
            <p>
                The history of the world is marked by revolutions. These revolutions always brought innovations and 
                a remarkable quantity of new information. Nowadays, we are living in the fourth stage of the Industrial 
                Revolution. This stage is also known as Digitization, and much more than an unpredictable amount of new 
                data, it brings to pass an important change in human habits. Humanity is becoming more connected and 
                integrated with services provided by the cloud. Furthermore, we are using the internet to discover, learn, 
                buy, and accomplish almost everything with a few touches of a fingertip. Therefore, an important strategy 
                for every business's growth is increasing its Internet visibility.
